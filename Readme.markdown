Provides a sample Ninject configuration that can change based on some
condition. This is an incredibly simplistic example (as most examples
are). However, the applications are impressive. For example, you may 
have different search strategies in place based on administrators vs.
regular users.

Built with Ninject 3.0.0.15.

Happy coding!
